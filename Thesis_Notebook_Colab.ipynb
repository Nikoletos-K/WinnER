        " \n",
        "__Entity resolution (ER)__ or Deduplication are among the research themes that have recently received escalated interest. ER is the process of creating systematic linkage between disparate data records that represent the same thing in reality, in the absence of a join key. For example, as a previous project that I made, say you have a dataset of camera records from multiple websites (Amazon, AliBaba, etc) and you want to find which of these records refer to the same real object. Records may have slightly different names, somewhat different descriptions, maybe similar prices, and totally different unique identifiers. This may heard no big deal, but taking into serious the volume of some datasets and databases, gets you to understand how challenging, in prospects of  accuracy and computability this is. ER applications are now used for multiple reasons, not only for avoiding duplicates in databases, but also for reasons like finding \"similar\" accounts in social media or email, that are connected to  criminal actions.     \n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of this project, is to make an Entity resolution system that performs both well in Precision, Recall and execution time.  In this work we embrace an embedding approach by selecting a number of pivot objects to act as prototypes for transforming a dissimilarity space of proximities into a reduced set of distances of objects from these prototypes. It is now important to make clear what a dissimilarity space is. This definition comes from the fields of Statistis and theoritical Machine Learning. \n",

        "Dissimilarities [[1]]() have been used in pattern recognition for a long time. In the first approach the dissimilarity matrix is considered as a set of row vectors, one for every object.  They represent the objects in a vector space constructed by the dissimilarities to the other objects.  Usually, this vector space is treated as a Euclidean space and equipped with the standard inner product definition. Let $ \\textit{X} = \\{ x_1, . . . , x_n \\} $ be a training set. Given a dissimilarity function and/or dissimilarity data, we define a data-dependent mapping $ D(·, R) : X → R $ from  $ X $ to the so-called __dissimilarity space (DS)__ . The $k-element$ set $R$ consists of\n",
        "objects that are representative for the problem. This set is called the representation or __prototype set__ and it may be a subset of X . In the dissimilarity space each dimension $ D(·, p_i) $ describes a dissimilarity to a prototype $ p_i $ from R. In this paper, we initially choose $ R := X $ . As a result, every object is described by an n-dimensional dissimilarity vector $ D(x, X ) = [d(x, x_1) . . . d(x, x_n)]^T $. The resulting vector space is endowed with the traditional inner product and the Euclidean metric.\n",

Informally, two sets are close in the Hausdorff distance if every point of either set is close to some point of the other set. The Hausdorff distance is the longest distance you can be forced to travel by an adversary who chooses a point in one of the two sets, from where you then must travel to the other set. In other words, it is the greatest of all the distances from a point in one set to the closest point in the other set.\n",

    "scheme. This framework consists of four parts. First part is the string clustering and prototype selection, in which clusters will be made that afterwords will be used for the string embedding. The second part in this methology is the string embedding into an N-dimensional Vantage space which has been generated by the prototype selection. Next, in the third part, it will be presented a distance measure that relies on Kendall tau\n",

    "__Entity resolution (ER)__ or Deduplication are among the research themes that have recently received escalated interest. ER is the process of creating systematic linkage between disparate data records that represent the same thing in reality, in the absence of a join key. For example, as a previous project that I made, say you have a dataset of camera records from multiple websites (Amazon, AliBaba, etc) and you want to find which of these records refer to the same real object. Records may have slightly different names, somewhat different descriptions, maybe similar prices, and totally different unique identifiers. This may heard no big deal, but taking into serious the volume of some datasets and databases, gets you to understand how challenging, in prospects of  accuracy and computability this is. ER applications are now used for multiple reasons, not only for avoiding duplicates in databases, but also for reasons like finding \"similar\" accounts in social media or email, that are connected to  criminal actions.     \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project, is to make an Entity resolution system that performs both well in Precision, Recall and execution time.  In this work we embrace an embedding approach by selecting a number of pivot objects to act as prototypes for transforming a dissimilarity space of proximities into a reduced set of distances of objects from these prototypes. It is now important to make clear what a dissimilarity space is. This definition comes from the fields of Statistis and theoritical Machine Learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Dissimilatiry Space\n",
    "\n",
    "Dissimilarities [1] have been used in pattern recognition for a long time. In the first approach the dissimilarity matrix is considered as a set of row vectors, one for every object.  They represent the objects in a vector space constructed by the dissimilarities to the other objects.  Usually, this vector space is treated as a Euclidean space and equipped with the standard inner product definition. Let $ \\textit{X} = \\{ x_1, . . . , x_n \\} $ be a training set. Given a dissimilarity function and/or dissimilarity data, we define a data-dependent mapping $ D(¬∑, R) : X ‚Üí R $ from  $ X $ to the so-called __dissimilarity space (DS)__ . The $k-element$ set $R$ consists of\n",
    "objects that are representative for the problem. This set is called the representation or __prototype set__ and it may be a subset of X . In the dissimilarity space each dimension $ D(¬∑, p_i) $ describes a dissimilarity to a prototype $ p_i $ from R. In this paper, we initially choose $ R := X $ . As a result, every object is described by an n-dimensional dissimilarity vector $ D(x, X ) = [d(x, x_1) . . . d(x, x_n)]^T $. The resulting vector space is endowed with the traditional inner product and the Euclidean metric.\n",

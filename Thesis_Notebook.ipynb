The second part in this methology is the string embedding into an N-dimensional Vantage space which has been generated by the prototype selection. Next, in the third part, it will be presented a distance measure that relies on Kendall tau\n",

    "__Entity resolution (ER)__ or Deduplication are among the research themes that have recently received escalated interest. ER is the process of creating systematic linkage between disparate data records that represent the same thing in reality, in the absence of a join key. For example, as a previous project that I made, say you have a dataset of camera records from multiple websites (Amazon, AliBaba, etc) and you want to find which of these records refer to the same real object. Records may have slightly different names, somewhat different descriptions, maybe similar prices, and totally different unique identifiers. This may heard no big deal, but taking into serious the volume of some datasets and databases, gets you to understand how challenging, in prospects of  accuracy and computability this is. ER applications are now used for multiple reasons, not only for not having duplicates in databases, but also for reasons like finding \"similar\" accounts in social media or email, that are connected to  criminal actions.
